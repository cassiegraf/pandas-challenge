    "DATA SUMMARY\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is sorted by the top 5 highest performing schools (by highest overall passing rate). All schools are Charter schools, with small-medium school sizes, a per-student budget between $578-$638, and an overall passing rate of 90-91%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is sorted by the bottom 5 performing schools (by lowest overall passing rate). All schools are District schools, with large school sizes, a per-student budget between $637-$655, and an overall passing rate of 52-53%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is sorted by the average math score by grade, per school name. By school name, the average math grade from 9th-12th grade is consistent. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is sorted by the average reading score by grade, per school name. By school name, the average reading grade from 9th-12th grade is consistent. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is sorted by spending ranges per student. The overall spending range per student has the lowest overall passing rate, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is sorted by school size – small, medium, large – the small/medium school size has the highest overall percent passing, 89-90%. The large school size has the lowest overall percent passing, 58%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is sorted by school type – charter, district – Charter schools have an overall percent passing of 90% and District schools have an overall passing of 53%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CONCLUSIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "Charter schools have a materially higher overall passing rate than district schools. This is likely due to the smaller school sizes (small/medium in size). The spending per student has little to no effect on the overall passing rate at charter schools. Charter schools spend slightly less per student than District schools but still have higher passing rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to Charter schools, district schools are larger in size (all large in size), spend more per student, and have the lowest overall passing rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The school type, charter vs district, is the most important factor when determining overall passing rates. \n"
